# Online-Food-ordering-system
An application created using Java Swings to order food online from a given menu. Upon doing so, a bill will be generated indicating the amount the user has to pay.

INTRODUCTION - 
The user interface of the project is very friendly. When the program is launched an introductory page is opened. When we click on “Order your food” button, it directs us to the menu section.
In this project, we have created a restaurant menu. The user can order the food by selecting the checkboxes and they will then automatically be transferred to the billing section. Addition and deletion of items is easy through this interface. The user needs to enter his customer details, after which a message box is generated which gives you your total bill amount.

MENU SECTION - 
The menu section consists of all food items available along with their price. The concept of checkbox is used here which means the user can order whatever food item he wants by simply ticking the checkbox.

CUSTOMER DETAILS SECTION - 
The user will have to enter their name and phone number for the billing process.

BILLING SECTION – 
In this section, the food items ordered are displayed. After ordering is done, on clicking the “Total Bill” button the total amount is displayed with 18% GST. After clicking the “Done” button a message box is displayed confirming the order.
This application is based on java programming language which is a platform independent language and can run in any of the operating environments. We just need Java Virtual Machine to be installed on our systems.
